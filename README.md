# RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (From Scratch)

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** built from scratch. RAG is a model architecture designed to combine the strengths of information retrieval and sequence generation to enhance question-answering, knowledge synthesis, and natural language generation tasks.

RAG operates in two stages:
1. **Retrieval**: The model first retrieves relevant documents from a corpus based on the input query.
2. **Generation**: Using the retrieved documents, the model generates a coherent response, augmenting its language generation capabilities with factual information from external sources.

## Features

- **Custom Retrieval Module**: Implements a retrieval mechanism using vector embeddings to search a corpus efficiently.
- **Custom Generation Module**: Uses a language generation model to synthesize answers based on retrieved information.
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Combines retrieval and generation into a seamless workflow for information-based text generation.
- **Extensible**: Easily adaptable to new datasets or different generation models.

## Installation

### Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on the framework you used)
- HuggingFace Transformers (for language models)
- FAISS (for efficient document retrieval)

You can install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rag-from-scratch.git
cd rag-from-scratch
```

## Usage

To run the RAG pipeline:

```bash
python main.py --query "Your question here" --corpus "path_to_corpus"
```

### Parameters:

- `--query`: The input question or text query.
- `--corpus`: The file path to the corpus containing documents to retrieve from.

## Model Architecture

The RAG model consists of two key components:

1. **Retriever**: Retrieves top `k` relevant documents from a large corpus using a similarity search (based on embeddings or other metrics like BM25).
2. **Generator**: A generative language model (e.g., GPT, BART, or T5) that processes the retrieved documents and generates a response conditioned on them.

### Diagram

[Input Query] --> [Retriever] --> [Top-k Documents] --> [Generator] --> [Generated Response]
```

- **Retriever**: Utilizes FAISS or custom vector search to find relevant documents.
- **Generator**: A pre-trained language model fine-tuned on the task of generating answers based on input context.

## Training

To train the model on a custom dataset:

1. Prepare the dataset with queries, documents, and target responses.
2. Run the training script:

```bash
python train.py --data "path_to_training_data" --epochs 10 --batch_size 32
```

## Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of the model on a validation set by running:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path "path_to_saved_model" --validation_data "path_to_validation_data"
```

Metrics such as accuracy, BLEU, or ROUGE will be calculated based on the generated responses.

## Examples

Here are some example queries and their generated responses:

1. **Query**: *What is RAG?*
   - **Response**: RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a model that combines document retrieval with sequence generation for answering questions or generating text based on retrieved content.

2. **Query**: *How does FAISS work in retrieval?*
   - **Response**: FAISS is an open-source library by Facebook AI that provides efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, often used for document retrieval in NLP tasks.
